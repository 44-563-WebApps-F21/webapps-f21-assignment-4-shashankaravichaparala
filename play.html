    <h3>ACT IV.  _Sitting-room in Mrs. Arbuthnot’s House at Wrockley_.</h3>
    <p>
      <br>  LADY HUNSTANTON.  Good morning, Gerald.
      <br>

GERALD.  [_Rising_.]  Good morning, Lady Hunstanton.  Good morning, Mrs.
<br>
Allonby.

LADY HUNSTANTON.  [_Sitting down_.]  We came to inquire for your dear
mother, Gerald.  I hope she is better?
<br>

GERALD.  My mother has not come down yet, Lady Hunstanton.
<br>

LADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah, I am afraid the heat was too much for her last
night.  I think there must have been thunder in the air.  Or perhaps it
was the music.  Music makes one feel so romantic—at least it always gets
on one’s nerves.
<br>

MRS. ALLONBY.  It’s the same thing, nowadays.
<br>

LADY HUNSTANTON.  I am so glad I don’t know what you mean, dear.  I am
afraid you mean something wrong.  Ah, I see you’re examining Mrs.
Arbuthnot’s pretty room.  Isn’t it nice and old-fashioned?
<br>

MRS. ALLONBY.  [_Surveying the room through her lorgnette_.]  It looks
quite the happy English home.
<br>

LADY HUNSTANTON.  That’s just the word, dear; that just describes it.
One feels your mother’s good influence in everything she has about her,
Gerald.
<br>

MRS. ALLONBY.  Lord Illingworth says that all influence is bad, but that
a good influence is the worst in the world.
<br>

LADY HUNSTANTON.  When Lord Illingworth knows Mrs. Arbuthnot better he
will change his mind.  I must certainly bring him here.
<br>

MRS. ALLONBY.  I should like to see Lord Illingworth in a happy English
home.
<br>

LADY HUNSTANTON.  It would do him a great deal of good, dear.  Most women
in London, nowadays, seem to furnish their rooms with nothing but
orchids, foreigners, and French novels.  But here we have the room of a
sweet saint.  Fresh natural flowers, books that don’t shock one, pictures
that one can look at without blushing.
<br>

MRS. ALLONBY.  But I like blushing.
<br>

LADY HUNSTANTON.  Well, there _is_ a good deal to be said for blushing,
if one can do it at the proper moment.  Poor dear Hunstanton used to tell
me I didn’t blush nearly often enough.  But then he was so very
particular.  He wouldn’t let me know any of his men friends, except those
who were over seventy, like poor Lord Ashton: who afterwards, by the way,
was brought into the Divorce Court.  A most unfortunate case.
<br>

MRS. ALLONBY.  I delight in men over seventy.  They always offer one the
devotion of a lifetime.  I think seventy an ideal age for a man.
